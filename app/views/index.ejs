      <h3>A user friendly workout log, for the new or seasoned lifter alike.</h3>
      <p>If you're an experienced lifter you probably know whatever workout you're doing in your head. But what if the gym is <em>really</em> busy and you can't get that rack you need? A freeform workout logging system lets you effortlessly log an alternate exercise so you can spend <em>more</em> time lifting and <em>less</em> time fiddling with your phone subbing out exercises in your preset program.</p>
